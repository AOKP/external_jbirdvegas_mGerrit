mGerrit Privacy Policy - Analytics
==================================

In order to help provide the best experience to users, prioritise new
 features and identify and correct issues mGerrit uses Google Analytics
 to collect certain information regarding how our users use the app.
We will NEVER collect any personally identifiable information (this is
 not permitted under the Google Analytics TOS anyway) and will not
 collect any personal information or data that is shared with others
 through mGerrit. If mGerrit accepts any usernames/passwords as part
 of an authentication process now or in the future, these will only be
 stored locally and not on any third-party server encrypted or otherwise.

Information collected and how it is used
----------------------------------------
- The Current ROM being used:
 Agregate data may be collected on what ROM is being used by the
  user. This will be used to determine what ROMs people who are
  most active on Gerrit use and to change the Gerrit instances which
  mGerrit officially supports.
- The current Gerrit that is being used
 Agregate data used in a similar way to the data collected on the
  current ROM being used. If one Gerrit instance that is not officially
  supported is regularly used, officially supporting it may be considered
  even if the server Gerrit version does not meet the minimum standard.
- Data transfer statistics:
 Statistics on how long the server takes to respond to requests, time
  taken to process the responses and error rates can be collected. This
  data can then be used to assist implementing data and batery optimisation
  strategies such as reducing the data transfered when using mobile data
  compared to a WiFi connection.
- Decoding failures
 Collecting data on failures processing server responses, particularly change
  diffs will help improve the decoding algorithms used to decode similar
  server respones.
- Search queries and the number of results returned:
 Collecting data on the way users write search queries will allow optimisation
  of search processing in mGerrit, adding support for more keywords and aliasing
  existing keywords.

Open Source
-----------
mGerrit is an open source application, as a result we will not (and cannot) hide
 any analytics tracking data from our users. Those that are particularly concerned
 regarding what data is collected can search through the source code.
When forking this project, it is advised to disable Google analytics to prevent
 incorrect or invalid data being mixed up in data collected from users that installed
 an official release of mGerrit signed with the Google play release key (either from
 Google Play or built-in to a custom ROM such as AOKP).
