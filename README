Change List Searching
-------------------
Searching the change lists, either the 'Review', 'Merged' or 'Abandoned' tabs is designed to mimic the functionality in the Gerrit
 web interface. As each change contains alot of different data, Gerrit uses what are known as operators. To avoid confusing these
 with what they call boolean operators we will call these "keywords".

Keywords: Act as restrictions on the search. As more keywords are added to the same query string, they further restrict the returned
 results.

As an example, searching for "subject:warnings" will return a list of chnages where the commit subject contains the string "warnings"
 in the locally stored changes for the current tab.

Note: these search queries operate on the data stored locally in the database and do not query the Gerrit server. It is recomended
 to refresh the data before quering to make sure the most recent changes will be available to be searched.
Currently, it is required to re-submit the search query when changing tabs as each one operates independently.

Supported keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently the following keywords are supported:

change:'ID'; changeid:'ID'
Either a legacy numerical ID such as 15183, or a newer style Change-Id that was scraped out of the commit message.

message:'MESSAGE'; subject:'MESSAGE'; intitle:'MESSAGE'
Changes that match MESSAGE arbitrary string in the first line of the commit message. The string MESSAGE can be quoted (") which will
 only show changes that contain exactly the string MESSAGE. If the string is unquoted and contains spaces, only the first word will
 be used.
